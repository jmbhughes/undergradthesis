- Sections 2 and 5
Append Section 5 to Section 2
"2 Background
2.1 Solar Physics
2.1.1 Space Weather Phenomenon
2.1.2 Solar Structures
2.2 Machine Learning
2.2.1 Naive Bayes
2.2.2 Random Forest
2.2.3 Aritificial Neural Network (describe CNN in this subsection as well)"

- Section 6
"6 Software package" --> "6 Automatically Generating Thematic Maps" (or some other phrasing of the same idea; "software package" is too vague.)

- Section 7
Since more people are accepting of quantitative analysis, pushing Qualitative analysis back may be beneficial. Also, justify why this is necessary, just like how you start Section 7.1.2.

Also, consider combining the other sections as Quantitative Analysis. It would flow better if you had a subsection on quantitative analysis and then qualitative analysis.

Add a description on experiment setup (train test split? cv? This should be detailed enough to allow replication). Depending on the length, create a new subsection or locate it in Section 7.1.

7.5
features should be described in Section 6. Seciton 7 should only be about the experiment setup, results and analysis.

- Section 9
State the conclusion then future work

E.g. "This thesis presents machine learning approaches to automatically generate thematic maps in real-time. In order to train these classifiers, we first constructed an annotated dataset using a custom-built visual annotation tool. The resulting dataset will be [contribution]. Using the dataset, we ..."
